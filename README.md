# Burger Assignment

For this homework assignment I learned a lot about the structure behind the MVC architecture.  The application is designed so that you can enter in burger names and they will dissappear when you check on devour.  The app has been deployed to heroku and uses the jawsdb add on in heroku.

## Comments

The big take away I got from this assignment was learning the concept behind using an ORM and how it relates to the model.  My initial thoughts about how to complete the assignment were to createa  model class, create a new instance of the model class and populate it's properties with data retrieved from the database.  However, with an ORM this is unneccessary as the information is returned repopulated in the data structure you need.
